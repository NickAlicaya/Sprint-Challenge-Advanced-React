- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      I would use class components so that I would have access to life cycle methods. Also if hooks are not to be used then I would definitely need
      to use class Components if the said component needs to be Stateful.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      Mounting:Constructor initializes data and renders it.
      Updating:updates the state and rerenders as necessary.
      Unmounting: The final part where data unmounts and basically finishes/dies/done. This is also where clean-up occurs

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      customHooks are a good example of DRY. It is technically just re-usable that can be used to manage multiple components for example managing
      multiple forms. It is very cost effective in terms of memory and is simply convenient especially when handling large batches of similar data, say for example managing forms.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      It is necessary to implement testing in order to minimize/prevent errors. This is an efficient way to save time and money.
